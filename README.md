# y2 Worker Client

The worker service for the y2 cluster.

## Setup

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install the website's required packages

## Package Management

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install all required dependencies
- `pip3 install <package_name>` to install a new package (you should probably add the newly install package to the project's list of dependencies)
- `pip3 freeze --local -r requirements.txt > requirements.txt` to update the list of requirements (without deleting any entry already present in the `requirements.txt` file)
